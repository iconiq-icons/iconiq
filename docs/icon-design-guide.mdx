## iconiq Icon Design Principles

All iconiq icons must follow these design principles.

### 1. Canvas Size: Icons must be designed on a **24 by 24 pixels** canvas.

### 2. Padding: Icons must have at least **1 pixel padding** within the canvas.

**Important:** No artwork may touch the edge of the canvas.

### 3. Stroke Width: Icons must have an **uniform stroke width of 2 pixels**.

### 4. Stroke Alignment: Icons must use **centered strokes**.

### 5. Stroke Joins: Icons must use **round joins**.

### 6. Stroke Caps: Icons must use **round caps**.

### 7. Grid: All anchor points and control points must fall on integer coordinates.

### 8. Curves must use SVG arcs or quadratic Béziers; cubic Béziers are allowed only if control vectors share mirrored angles for perfectly smooth joins.

### 9. Corner Radii: Shapes (such as rectangles) must have a **border radius of**

#### a. **2 pixels** if they are at least 8 pixels in size

#### b. **1 pixel** if they are smaller than 8 pixels in size

### 10. Element Spacing: Distinct path groups or shapes must be separated by at least **2 pixels of clear space (measured between their nearest bounding-box edges).**

### 11. Optical Weight: Icons should have a similar optical volume to `circle` and `square`.

**Tip:** place your icon next to the circle or square icon and blur them both; your icon should not feel much darker than the base shape.

### 12. Visual Center: Icons should be visually centered by their center of gravity.

**Tip:** place your icon both above/below and next to the square or circle icon and check if it feels off center. Symmetrical icons should always be aligned to the center.

### 13. Visual Density: Icons should have similar visual density and level of detail.

**Tip:** try to make abstractions to dense elements. Blur your icon, and when blurred it should not feel overly dark.

### 14. Continuous Curves: Continuous curves should join smoothly.

**Tip:** make sure to use arcs or quadratic curves. When using cubic curves control points should have mirrored angles for smooth curves.

### 15. Pixel Perfect Sharpness: Icons should aim to be pixel perfect so that they will be sharp on low DPI displays.

**Tip:** whenever possible align elements and arc centers to the grid.

## SVG Code Conventions

Before an icon is added to the library, it must have readable and optimized SVG code.

Every SVG must conform exactly to this template and use only allowed elements.

### Global Attributes

For each icon these attributes are applied, corresponding to the above rules.

```xml
<svg
  xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  width="24"
  height="24"
  viewBox="0 0 24 24"
  fill="none"
  stroke="currentColor"
  stroke-width="2"
  stroke-linecap="round"
  stroke-linejoin="round"
>
  <!-- Only the SVG elements below -->
</svg>
```

### Allowed elements

SVG files may only contain simple path and shape elements, which may not have any attributes other than sizing and spacing.

Only the following elements and attributes are allowed:

- `<path d="…"/>`
- `<line x1 y1 x2 y2/>`
- `<polyline points="…"/>`
- `<polygon points="…"/>`
- `<circle cx cy r/>`
- `<ellipse cx cy rx ry/>`
- `<rect x y width height rx/>`

**Disallowed elements:** any `<use>`, `<g>`, `<defs>`, transforms, filters, gradients, fills, explicit `stroke` overrides, or metadata tags.

**Disallowed attributes:** any attributes other than sizing and spacing.

### Path Precision

Coordinates and numbers must be rounded to one decimal place (e.g. 12.5, not 12.4678).

SVG output must be minified: remove whitespace and unused attributes while preserving readability of the `<path>` data.

`svgo` must be used to minify the SVG code.

## Icon Metadata Conventions

Each icon must also ship with a JSON descriptor named `<IconName>.json` alongside `<IconName>.svg`.

The JSON must follow the iconiq `icon.schema.json` schema:

```json
{
  "name": "example-icon",
  "displayName": "ExampleIcon",
  "a11yLabel": "An example icon demonstrating the proper structure",
  "tags": ["example", "demo", "template"],
  "categories": ["miscellaneous"],
  "keywords": ["sample", "template", "demonstration"],
  "aliases": ["demo-icon", "sample-icon"],
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "deprecated": false,
  "variants": {
    "outline": { "viewBox": "0 0 24 24", "path": "..." },
    "filled": { "viewBox": "0 0 24 24", "path": "..." },
    "sharp": { "viewBox": "0 0 24 24", "path": "..." }
  },
  "author": "Iconiq Icons",
  "license": "MIT",
  "defaultProps": {
    "size": 24,
    "strokeWidth": 2,
    "absoluteStrokeWidth": false
  }
}
```

## Icon Naming Conventions

1. Icon names use lower PascalCase.\
   For example: `ArrowUp` instead of `arrow-up`.

2. Icon names use International English names, as opposed to local variants.\
   For example: `color` instead of `colour`.

3. Icons should be named for what they depict rather than their use case or what they represent.\
   For example: `FloppyDisk` instead of `Save` and `CircleSlash` rather than `Ban`.

4. Icons that are part of a group are named `<group>-<variant>`.\
   For example: `BadgePlus` is based on `Badge`.

5. Icon names for alternate icons should represent what makes the alternate unique instead of being numbered.\
   For example: `SendHorizontal` instead of `Send2`.

6. Names containing numerals are not allowed, unless the number itself is represented in the icon.\
   For example: `ArrowDown0To1` contains both numerals.

7. Icons depicting multiple elements (e.g. a person and a circle) of different sizes must list these elements in decreasing order of size.\
   For example: if the circle is bigger, it should be `CirclePerson`, if the person is bigger, it should be `PersonCircle`.

8. Icons depicting multiple elements of roughly equal sizes (e.g. a `ruler` and a `pencil`) must list these elements front to back in case one element is in front of the other, otherwise in English reading order (top to bottom, left to right).\
   For example: if the `pencil` is either in front of, above or left of `ruler`, it should be `PencilRuler`, otherwise, it should be `RulerPencil`.

9. Icons depicting some sort of variation of an element must use the `[element]-[modifier]` naming scheme, with modifiers being applied to each element respectively.\
   For example: a dashed circle must be named `CircleDashed`, not `DashedCircle`, and in coordination with the previous guidelines, a dashed circle containing a broken heart would be named `CircleDashedHeartBroken`, due to the heart being smaller than the circle.
